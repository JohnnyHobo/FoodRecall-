# Welcome to Food Recall!
**Food Recall!** Is a mobile application that I came up with after a bad case of food poisoning, it allows you to easily search the FDA's recall database to see if food in your pantry has been recalled using a barcode or by just typing the name of the product in!

# Installation
## Android

The recommended way to install is through the Google Play Store which hosts our newest stable release, but you can download the APK from our github as well and install that way if you prefer.

## iOS

Unfortunately, we do not support iOS at this time :( It is cost-prohibitive to get an Apple Developer license for free applications, but we are planning on releasing an IPA you can manually install onto your device in the near future.
