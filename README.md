# Welcome to Food Recall!
**Food Recall!** Is a mobile application that I came up with after a bad case of food poisoning, it allows you to easily search the FDA's recall database to see if food in your pantry has been recalled using a barcode or by just typing the name of the product in!

# Installation
## Android

We're working on getting our app onto the Google Play Store, until then, you can [download our latest version here](../../releases/download/v0.0.1-Android/FoodRecall.apk)

## iOS

Unfortunately, we do not support iOS at this time :( It is cost-prohibitive to get an Apple Developer license for free applications, but we are planning on releasing an IPA you can manually install onto your device in the near future.
